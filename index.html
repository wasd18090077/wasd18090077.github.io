    I am most happy with making my own site.
  </p>
  <p>
    I found it difficult to coding the html.
  </p>
  <p>
    Next time I want to improve the visual style of the website by adding custom CSS and experimenting with different colours.

    This week I learn many new things from my lessons, like some fuction of program and learn about logic gate from computer achitecture.
    I pround of my whole website, beacuse this is my first time to have a own website, although it just need to press few button to make it, I will make the website better at the future.
    I think writing in english is the most challenging for me. Because english not my first language and I not good at it. I always feel difficult of using english.
    I learn binary from this work. At the past, I just know a little about binary, but now, I already fully understand what binary is, I'm glad, that I can learn about binary.
    About one concrete improvement that I want to make next week, I like to make my website look better ,such as improving the visual style.
